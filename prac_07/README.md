# CP1404 Practicals 7

## About This Repository

This repository contains my practical exercises for the subject **CP1404 - Programming II** at [James Cook University](https://www.jcu.edu.au/).  
It includes a variety of small projects and exercises focusing on Python programming, object-oriented design, clean coding practices, and more.

### About Me

My name is Carol, a student currently studying **Bachelor of Cybersecurity**.  
This repo reflects my learning progress and growth in Python development.


## Clean Code Lessons Learned

- **Meaningful names**: Choosing clear and descriptive variable, function, and class names makes code easier to understand and maintain.
- **Single Responsibility Principle (SRP)**: Writing small, focused functions and classes that do one thing well improves readability and reusability.
- **DRY Principle (Don't Repeat Yourself)**: Avoiding code duplication by using functions and loops makes code cleaner and more efficient.
