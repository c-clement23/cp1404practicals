## Estimates

Regarding the **estimates** that you did for practical tasks...

### How was your estimate accuracy usually?

I think I could guess the time with reasonable accuracy but sometimes it'll be off by an hour or so.

### How did your estimate accuracy improve or change during the course of the subject?

It can change depending on how much logic the code needs, I'll have to refer to the previous codes I have done for 
certain exercises.

### What did you learn from doing these estimates?

I can allocate or at least try to allocate time and resources for these practicals as it needs.

## Code Reviews

### What have you learned from being reviewed by other people?

## Practicals

### Regarding the **practical tasks** overall, what would you change if you were in charge of the subject?

I can't really think of any.

### What did you do really well for practicals in this subject?

The only thing that I've done well for this subject is trying to meet the deadline for the most part but even then I've
missed quite a few of them. Otherwise, I think I've tried my best in understanding the logic behind the practicals' 
exercises.
